**Hi, I'm Chiao-Chieh, Deng 👋**

I'm a psychology major at National Chengchi University (NCCU), with a growing passion for data science, AI, and human-centered technology.
I’m also drawn to the visual side of tech, which led me to explore frontend and creative design.

- 💻 I'm currently learning React.js and Deep learning
- 🐻 Preparing for an exchange to UC Berkeley (Fall 2025)
